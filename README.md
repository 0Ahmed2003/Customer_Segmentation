# 👥 Customer Segmentation Project

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct customer segments based on behavior and demographics.

## 📊 Project Overview
Using clustering techniques, this notebook uncovers meaningful patterns in consumer data that can inform targeted business decisions.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardization of features for unbiased clustering.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better visualization and performance.
- **Clustering Model:** K-Means clustering with evaluation via elbow and silhouette methods.
- **Visualization:** 2D/3D scatter plots and cluster centroids to explore segments.
- **Dashboard:** Interactive Plotly Dash app for exploring segment distributions and characteristics.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (PCA, KMeans)
- Plotly, Dash, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Insights
The final model revealed distinct customer segments with varied behavior, enabling potential for personalized marketing and service improvements.
